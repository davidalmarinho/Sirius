This system exists, because when saving the game objects, we may have an instance of a Component
inside another component.
That instance, if save.txt was loaded, must also be from saved game object / component from that file.
So, each component and game object will have a unique ID. When loading the file, if some game object or
some component has the determined ID, it will be loaded from there.
